# TimeRiver
MMO Service

Research proves that we are not forgetting what we have experienced, just canâ€™t evoke.

In the most basic time, the data of logged-out players will not be cleared from the memory. If you can remember the user name and immediately log in, you can synchronize the data, otherwise, the data will wait forever in the long river of time.

This is also the origin of the name "Time River"
